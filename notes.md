#Hi Cole and Mike

#Chapter by Chapter review of Fallen Magus book two: The last lead

###Chapter 35 is the most important part.

#General comments:
* Avoid past participle unless you're really describing something indirectly
* Favor pronouns a bit more compared to aliases eg. the former Magus -> he.  (doing that is fine, it just seems overused)
* Beware conjunctions when no logical connection is apparent.
* Avoid present participle phrases eg. __Closing his eyes__, Marcus took in a deep breath from his nose (Chapter 18).  People can read 700 page Harry Potter books in a week because JK Rowling almost never does this.  It wrong-foots the reader because the action comes before the doer.  A fast read is really important for this genre.  This sentence can be rewritten as: "Marcus closed his eyes and took a deep breath".
* Don't explain the obvious.  Take the previous sentence, of course he took the deep breath 'in' and 'from (through would be better) his nose'.  Who 'takes' deep breaths out through the mouth?  The reader will paint the right picture, don't overburden them.  
* If this advice seems too sparse, liven it up with vocabulary.  Sure "Marcus closed his eyes and took a deep breath" is kinda boring.  Consider: "Marcus inhaled deeply and let his heavy eyelids fall"

#Chapter 19: Helena goes to Imperia
* This is when the quality of the flashback chapters really picks up.  I wrote, best flashback of the series so far at the end, but later ones were even better.  It's interesting because this one has arguably the least action which is the most well written and engaging situation in these books.  What makes this chapter better is the world building.  The information is relevant and interesting and fills in a good deal of the character's backgrounds without doing so explicitly.  The nobility is an important part of all the character's experiences, and imperial society puts them in a broader and more relatable context.
* I also get a good sense of what draws Marcus to Helena even at his advanced age.  He's seen so many people (generations!), he would be about as old as Ben Franklin, it's hard to imagine that he could become attracted or so attached to an individual. And yet, I get it.  She's a got a touch of the manic pixie dream girl while being a leader and an incredible talent.  She's very down to Earth (Imperia) in a way that I can imagine being very rare.
* Of course, and this is a refrain you'll hear from me throughout, Marcus as a character is also problematic in this chapter.  
	1. He's short (and very short if he's 2-3 in. shorter than her).  This is not the image of Marcus that I've had for the past book and a half.  That's jarring. Either this needs to be made clear in book one and a lot of the description needs to be rewritten, or you can make him a bit taller and not mention it here.
	2. He's awkward.  300 year old people should not be described as if they were in "Perks of being a wallflower".  Marcus' immaturity keeps popping up and I cannot countenance it.  He's conquered worlds and empires, he's essentially immortal.  He can't be awkward.  Pained yes.  Aloof yes. Impersonal yes.  Awkward no.  Awkwardness arises from a desire to impress people, to make them see you a certain way.  Lonely?  Sure.  But he's seen his childhood friends' great-great-great grandchildren get old and die.  No one in that situation could continue putting undue emphasis on something as ephemeral as other people's favor.
* Errors:
	* Where should be wear
	* Cloths should be clothes - _this one keeps popping up_
	* Eminent should be imminent
	* Per say should be per se - _c'mon guys, that's Latin, this is ostensibly about Rome_

# Chapter 20: Mel goes antiquing 
* Good.  It moves the plot a bit.  This get's Mel right and actually she's better through the rest of the book.  Her interiority was somewhat tiresome in the first half. The difference here is a crisis so you've written her thoughts differently. 
* I suppose it's a stylistic choice, but I really don't like the emotion list.  I'm not a nazi for the __SHOW DON'T TELL__ theory of writing, but this kind of telling is overboard. 
* Minor issue:  Perhaps the currency situation in this world should be fleshed out more.  When Mel exclaims at the price at the end, I'm just confused.
* Errors:
	* Belayed should be belied
	* Taping should be tapping
	* Per say should be per se

#Chapter 21: Mopey Marcus goes full goth
* [Marcus](https://youtu.be/X8UR2TFUp8w)
* I've already said that Marcus is as old as Ben Franklin and he's conquered empires.  He fought the Mino-Taur one on one.  Sure, he's not that guy anymore, but that doesn't mean every ounce of that guy should be gone.  No dignity left.  He'd make the South Park goths say, "dude, cheer up."
* Generally I like the books.  The world is well-thought out and engaging.  The alternate vocabulary sucks you into it.  But I really hate this chapter.  It's hard to have much constructive criticism for it.  It doesn't move the plot, consider cutting it entirely.  If I picked this series up in a store I would have stopped reading here.
* On the other side, "Hi, Rufus!"  That was a good touch.
* Actually I really like that song.

#Chapter 22: Ark's Mistake
* Very good.  I made zero comments in the text of this chapter.
* Overall it was entertaining and a very strong chapter.  Indeed it redeemed the previous chapter almost entirely.  There are no mistakes, the characters are logical and consistent.  Greg's backstory is entertaining and so it's Mel's exchange with Slevin.  These elements really give dimension to the characters (we see so much of Mel with Marcus; it's illuminating to see her interact with someone else).  
* Really I think the chapter is so good because Marcus and Diana aren't there and Mel isn't talking about Marcus.  

#Chapter 23: Rufus' end?
* Lots of comments in the text of the chapter.
	* Nothing should be surreal to a 300 year old Magus who was previously a demi-god.  Certainly not a relatively understandable coincidence, i.e. Rufus.
	* Why would Marcus feel anything but pride about helping the Khanus Empire annex Saul's Rock.  The place is a shithole and he spent several lifetimes helping the empire do just that.  It's not like it would make any sense for him to lose his powers and his ideology of those lifetimes immediately.  So it's not a jab.
	* Just after that he get's very angry at Rufus for being a little vague.  He's incredibly touchy and guilty, like a teenager.
	* What on Earth has Marcus done to disrespect Helena's memory?  Srsly.
* Overall it's pretty good.  Rufus helps lubricate the narrative.  It kinda moves the plot.  I guess Stoat and his position will have more to do in the next book.  And why isn't Diana talking.  She doesn't seem like the kind of person to stay fully silent.

#Chapter 24: Greg joins the club.
## Or What we talk about when we talk about VR
* I have written at the end of the chapter: __Best chapter of the series so far__
* Well done!

#Void and Tower! - A brief Marxist reading of Fallen Magus Book Two

<!--- 
Themes of power vs freedom.  Empire vs Anarchy.  The way the inherent human power of Marcus and Helena is twisted into a tool for the elite and their civilizing yet brutalizing effect on the galaxy they inhabit.
